# DevOps Deployment

A comprehensive DevOps implementation demonstrating CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code, containerization, security scanning, and monitoring for a production-ready Node.js application.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This project implements a secure, scalable infrastructure using:
- **Application**: Node.js/Express API with health checks
- **Containerization**: Docker with security best practices
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with automated testing and deployment
- **Security**: Trivy vulnerability scanning, security groups
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana stack

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker Hub account
- GitHub repository
- Docker installed locally

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd devops-deployment
```

### 2. Local Development
```bash
npm install
npm test
npm start:dev

# Test endpoints
curl http://localhost:8080/
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

### 3. Build and Test Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t demo-app:latest .
docker run -p 8080:8080 demo-app:latest
```

### 4. Deploy
```bash
# commit and push to GitHub, CI-CD will kick in and deploy.
git commit -m "new changes"
git push
```

## SSL/TLS Implementation

For a robust SSL/TLS implementation, we can use Let's Encrypt with Certbot. This will provide free, automated, and up-to-date SSL/TLS certificates.

In the Kubernetes Cluster setup, I have added the ingress.yaml file to the k8s directory and set a domain name in the ingress.yaml. Also I have added cluster-issuer.yaml to manage Let's Encrypt which is the cert provider for both the staging and production deployment. 

I will install cert-manager Helm chart on the kubernetes cluster to manage the certificates. I will also install NGINX Ingress Controller to manage the ingress. 



## Things to Improve
1.**Robust Release Management** Improve on the CI-CD to incorporate a robust release management workflow. This will involve using clear-cut versioning system instead of commit hash. This will help humans to easily identify builts source code and images and think about the images in terms of sequence rather than random alphanumeric hash which doesn't tell human which is first and which is last. It will also help to quickly recover from bugs since images can easily be identified in sequence. Rollback to earlier version will be alot smoother and predictable when difficult bugs that can't be fixed on the spot is detected.

2.**Proper Git Workflow** Introduce proper git workflow to create deployment channel for different environment. There should be a staging environment (that is in most case similar to production environment) where application can be tested in a controlled environment before releasing to the public prod environment

3.**Helm Deployment** I'm going to improve on the kubernetes deployment to use Helm, this will greatly help in templating and eradicate hard-coding. With Helm, there will not be any need to create multiple versions of a manifest as variables can be used to substitute needed values as appropriate from the Helm template. Also there will be no need to use complex Sed command as Helm can effectively handle substitution of variables.

4.**Auto-scaling Capability** I would improve on auto-scaling capability of the application using HPA and Kubernetes cluster using cluster auto-scaling feature. This will make the Fin-Tech app more scalable and resilient to high traffic periods.

5.**Monitoring Stack** I have added some monitoring config files to the repo. I would finish implementation of the monitoring stack by installing prometheus, alert manager and grafana helm chart on the kubernetes cluster to scrape metrics, report and visualize insights from the infrastructure and running applications. This will help in identifying and resolving issues before they impact the users.
